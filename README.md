# ToTheMoon
2ND ALL-BY-MYSELF GAME DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

+ All mechanics working well
+ Style is childish and animations are cute
+ Can show player statistics at the end


Problems:
- Collectibles are hard to pick, borders can be wider
- Players don't read text
- Players don't get "Kraken attack"
- Game time is like 20m, collecting coins might be boring
- No save system
